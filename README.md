===========

Dev folder:
Runs app through sinatra. Does this to avoid cross-domain issues. Also auto compiles slim and coffeescript for you.

install gems: shotgun, sinatra, coffee-script

Start server:
shotgun run.rb

I'll create a deploy script to move the correct files over to the prod folder. Which will be the actual chrome extension.
